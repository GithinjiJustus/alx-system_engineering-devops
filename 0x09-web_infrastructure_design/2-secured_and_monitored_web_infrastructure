# Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure Explanation

## Components:
1. **Web Servers (Nginx):**
   - Multiple web servers serve encrypted traffic over HTTPS.

2. **Application Servers:**
   - Executes application logic and processes dynamic content requests.

3. **Load Balancer (HAProxy):**
   - Distributes incoming HTTPS traffic across web servers.

4. **Firewalls:**
   - Implemented to control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic for enhanced security.

5. **SSL Certificate:**
   - Used to encrypt traffic between clients and servers, ensuring data confidentiality.

6. **Monitoring Clients:**
   - Installed on each server to collect performance and usage data for monitoring purposes.

## Specifics:
- **Additional Elements Rationale:** 
   - Firewalls added for network security and traffic control.
   - SSL certificate ensures secure communication between clients and servers.
   - Monitoring clients collect and transmit performance data to monitoring tools.
- **Firewall Role:** Protects the infrastructure by filtering and controlling network traffic.
- **HTTPS Traffic:** Serves encrypted traffic to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
- **Monitoring Purpose:** Collects data on server performance, usage, and availability for proactive issue detection and resolution.
- **QPS Monitoring:** Utilizes monitoring tools to track and analyze web server's Query Per Second (QPS) metric for performance evaluation.

## Issues:
- **SSL Termination Issue:** Terminating SSL at the load balancer level exposes potential security risks.
- **Single MySQL Server for Writes:** Single point of failure and scalability limitation for write operations.
- **Uniform Server Components:** Homogeneous server components increase vulnerability to widespread failures.
