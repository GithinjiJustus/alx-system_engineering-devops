# Scale Up

## Introduction

In this task, we aim to scale up our web infrastructure by introducing additional components and splitting existing ones to improve performance and reliability.

## Requirements

- **1 Server:**
  - We will add one server to accommodate the increased load and distribute the workload effectively.

- **1 Load-Balancer (HAProxy) Configured as Cluster with Another One:**
  - HAProxy will be configured as a cluster with another instance to provide high availability and distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.

- **Split Components:**
  - The components, including the web server, application server, and database, will be split onto their own individual servers. This separation enhances scalability, fault isolation, and resource management.

## Specifics

- **Additional Elements Rationale:**
  - Adding another server and load-balancer enhances scalability and fault tolerance, ensuring the infrastructure can handle increased traffic and recover from failures.
  
- **Load-Balancer Configuration:**
  - HAProxy will be configured as a cluster with another instance to provide redundancy and distribute traffic evenly across servers, improving performance and reliability.
  
- **Splitting Components:**
  - Splitting components onto separate servers allows for better resource allocation, isolation of faults, and easier management and scaling of individual components.

## Conclusion

By implementing the above requirements and specifics, we aim to enhance the scalability, reliability, and performance of our web infrastructure to meet the demands of increased traffic and ensure seamless operation.
